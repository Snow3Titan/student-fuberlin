Master Planetary Sciences and Space Exploration @Freie Universitaet Berlin

Student Mentor: Louis Mueller

Orientation Webpage for New Students

1. Project Description

This is a project to create an external link-map webpage for new students starting their studies at Freie Universitaet Berlin. 
Due to the complex distribution of vital points of contact, administration and learning, throughout the campus of Freie Universitaet Berlin, 
finding their way in the early days of their studies can be disorienting for new students. 

2. Running the Project
